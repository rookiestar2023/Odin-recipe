    <strong><p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.</p></strong>
    <p>Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor.
        
    <p> It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
    <p>These are the ingrediants you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <strong><li>Noodles</li></strong>
        <p>This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</p>
        <strong><li>Butter</li></strong>
        <p>You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</p>
        <strong><li>Parmeson</li></strong>
        <p>Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</p>
        <strong><li>Salt and Pepper</li></strong>
        <p>Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</p>
    </ul>
