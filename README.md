This is my first odin project.
I have to make a webpage with only using HTML about recipes.
I will try my best to make it as pretty as possible.
Hi! Today's my second day of making my first HTML only websiet and it's pretty eeasy and I think it will get harder in the future but also easier in a weird way because of all the tools that exits today to help you make your websites better and quicker as well.

I started this because I have a passion for tech and I liked fideling with computers all the time.  would take apart my family pc just to see what was inside that's making it do the things that it is supposed to do. I failed miserably at first but kept at it and now her I am building a website on a sick pc that I assembled myself without any help!

About the website I will finish it in 4 hours max! Today.
